.  map() function takes an array of values and applies a transformation to each value in the array. It does not mutate the original array. It is often used to transform an array of data into a new array with a different structure.

. filter() function takes an array and returns a new array with only the values that meet certain criteria. It also does not mutate the original array. It is often used to select a subset of data from an array based on certain criteria.
