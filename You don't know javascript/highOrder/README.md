How to Use Higher Order Functions
most common High order functions map(), filter() and reduce()

.  map() function takes an array of values and applies a transformation to each value in the array. It does not mutate the original array. It is often used to transform an array of data into a new array with a different structure.

. filter() function takes an array and returns a new array with only the values that meet certain criteria. It also does not mutate the original array. It is often used to select a subset of data from an array based on certain criteria.

. reduce() method,is used when you want to perform some operation on the elements of an array and return a single value as a result. The "single value" refers to the accumulated result of repeatedly applying a function to the elements of a sequence.
