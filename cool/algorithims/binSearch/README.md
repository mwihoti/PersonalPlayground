Binary Search algorithim: - an efficient algorithim for finding an item from a sorted list.

Works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

Methods to interpret the binary search algorithim
    1. Iterative method
    2. Recursive method

recursive method follows divide and conquer approach.
