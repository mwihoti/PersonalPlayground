UnitTest

UnitTest supports:-

Test fixture - preparation needed to perform one or more tests and any associated cleanup actions.

Test-case - the individual of unit testing. checks for a specific response to a particular set of inputs.
    unittest provides a base class, TestCase which may be used to create new test cases.

Test suite - collection of test cases. It is used to aggregate tests that should be executed together.

Test runner - components which orchestrates the execution of tests and provides the outcome to the user.


unittests module provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests.

Paramatized unit Testing - allows us to define and execute test cases with different sets of input test data. It involves creating test methods or functions that accept parameters and then running these tests with various input values to validate the behaviour of the code under test.
