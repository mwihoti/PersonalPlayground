Perhaps santa shouldn't have to deliver all the presents by himself.

Perhaps we have an algorithm which he can divide the work of delivering presents amog his elves.

algorithm:
    1. appoint an elf and give work to himself
    2. Assign titles and responsibilities to the elves based on the number of houses for which
        they are responsibilities

            -> He is a manager and can appoint two elves and divide his work among them.
            -> He is a worker and has to deliver the presents to the house assigned to him.
