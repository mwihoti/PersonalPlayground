Suppose Santa shouldnâ€™t have to deliver all the presents by himself. I propose an algorithm with which he can divide the work of delivering presents among his elves:

Appoint an elf and give all the work to him
Assign titles and responsibilities to the elves based on the number of houses for which they are responsible:
> 1 He is a manager and can appoint two elves and divide his work among them
= 1 He is a worker and has to deliver the presents to the house assigned to him
